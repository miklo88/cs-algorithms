understanding - so you have to understand that is is very vague. now i discovered the readmes in each 
folder lol
creating a function that moves the non-zeros to the left side of the array. 
order of non zero ints does not matter.
"what i need to do." i need to be able to re-order an array
"how will i do it"
you have to loop throught the array to read the values no?
if any values aren't zero they must shift to the left.


'''
def moving_zeroes(arr):
    # Your code here

    pass


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Use the main function here to test out your implementation
    arr = [0, 3, 1, 0, -2]

    print(f"The resulting of moving_zeroes is: {moving_zeroes(arr)}")
